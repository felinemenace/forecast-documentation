# Chromium "Critical" (SEP2018)
Scenario: Will a "Critical" Chromium exploit be discovered "in the wild" in September 2018?
Outcome: TBD
Score: TBD
Discussion:

  - This is the first forecast to have data prepared for participants.
  - My first to include some basic modeling for forecasters.
  - My first to include interviews for forecasters.
  - New forecasters have trouble with sub 1% predictions, need guidance on frequency (1 month per decade, etc)
  - Opinions on political climate and ever-increasing likelihood due to hoarding is involved in the decision. Midterms, Russia, NK, Brexit. Opposition to this claims that news media has little to do with burning 0day, as the most important stuff is generally individualized and opportunistic, unlikely to be used where attention is pointed.
  - Without the current political climate, several forecasters would put `Yes` at 1% or lower.
  - Not all participants are trained, and some are new to forecasting, which will increase noise.

# Struts (CVE-2018-11776)
Scenario: Will attacks exploiting the Apache Struts vulnerability (CVE-2018-11776) be observed by the community "in-the-wild?"
Outcome: *Correct (34%) on Aug-27-2018*
Score: .104
Discussion:

  - This had problems with forecasters understanding "In The Wild"? Next time it will be bolstered to included honeypot activity, and differentiate between ITW vulns and ITW exploits.
  - Disclosed Aug-22-2018, PoC around Aug-26-2018, Exploitation Aug-27-2018
  - Calibration training is looking more important. Some forecasts were wild.
  - Wrote "[In The Wild](IN-THE-WILD.md)" documentation.
